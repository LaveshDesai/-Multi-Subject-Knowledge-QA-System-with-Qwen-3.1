# 🏆 Huawei Tech Arena Hackathon Project  
**Top 10 Finalist out of 150+ Teams**

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Huawei Tech Arena Hackathon**, where our team secured a **Top 10 position among 150+ teams**. The solution focuses on building an **LLM-powered Question Answering system** that combines retrieval and generation to deliver accurate, context-aware responses.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Large Language Models often produce responses without grounding in domain-specific data. The challenge was to design a system that enhances answer reliability by integrating **retrieval mechanisms with generative AI**.

---

## ⚙️ Solution Architecture
The system follows a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline:
1. Retrieve relevant documents from a custom knowledge base using BM25.
2. Inject retrieved context into structured prompts.
3. Generate accurate answers using a Large Language Model.
